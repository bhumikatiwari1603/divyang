### Divyang - Hiring portal for people with disabilities  (india specific)

__Abstract__: 
A Job portal which aggregates different jobs from online platforms and classifys them based upon the government  policy for disable people. It also is portal for employers where they can post.
__Proposed solution:__
Job searching is hard enough, but even more so when you have a disability. Fortunately, we are here to 
help. We at Divyang, provide a job portal specifically targeting people with disability and helping them connect with employers hiring in their field of interest. We plan on creating a user interface, where it is easier for job seekers to find opportunities seamlessly and also get job alerts emailed to their inbox. We also plan on using external APIâ€™s and machine learning algorithms, which would look through targeted website and find out jobs listed for people with disability, thereby making our website a one stop place for people looking for jobs. We are also thinking of using a job recommendation engine running on collaborative filtering and other machine learning algorithms, which will tailor job alerts as per the user profile and interests, by leveraging data from other similar user profiles
